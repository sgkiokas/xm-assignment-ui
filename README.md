# XM UI assignment
## Description
This repo contains the code for the UI-related assignment for XM. It uses Java 17 and it's build via `gradle`. In order to keep the 
code clean, `checkstyle` has been introduced.

## How to run the tests
The tests are located in `src/test/java/ui/test` folder.

To build the project, along with checkstyle validation, please run`./gradlew clean build` on Mac or use
the `gradlew.bat` for Windows. To simply run the tests, please run `./gradlew :test`.
